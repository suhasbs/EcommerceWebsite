1,"Eckhart Tolle,","
A New Earth: Create A Better Life focuses on helping individuals do their bit to enrich and spiritually strengthen humanity, while simultaneously seeking health and happiness in their own lives.

Summary Of The Book

	This book serves as a follow-up book to the author’s bestselling 1999 book, The Power Of Now, which promoted the idea that in order to achieve lasting happiness, human beings must learn to dissociate their thoughts from their identities. A New Earth: Create A Better Life builds extensively upon the same primary theme, exploring a different perspective this time around.

	The first book had an introspective quality and focused on the spiritual needs of the individual. On the other hand, this book turns the spotlight outwards, choosing to highlight the ways in which an individual’s spiritual evolution can be instrumental in shaping humanity’s collective spiritual consciousness.

	Divided into ten chapters, the book begins with a chapter on the awakening of human consciousness. The next three chapters focus on the concept of ego, exploring how attachment towards one’s thoughts, memories, and possessions can give rise to an illusory and harmful sense of self.

	In the subsequent chapters, the author discusses concepts such as recurring emotional pain, the space of consciousness, and inner and outer purpose. The final chapter presents the three elements that the author considers to be collectively representative of an awakened consciousness.

	A New Earth: Create A Better Life was first published in 2005 by Penguin. It went on to receive high worldwide acclaim, its popularity scaling further when it was chosen as a recommended title by Oprah Winfrey’s Book Club in 2008. This edition is a 2009 reprint by Penguin Books.

About Eckhart Tolle

	Eckhart Tolle is a German-Canadian author and public speaker.

	He has written books such as Guardians Of Being, A New Earth: Awakening To Your Life’s Purpose, The Power Of Now: A Guide To Spiritual Enlightenment, Oneness With All Life: Inspirational Selections from A New Earth, and Stillness Speaks: Whispers of Now.

	Distinctly permeated by a highly spiritual quality, Tolle’s writing explores psychology, metaphysics, and other realms of the esoteric.

	Tolle was born as Ulrich Leonard Tolle in 1948 in Germany. He had a very turbulent and disturbed childhood. With the consent of his father, he chose to study language, literature, and astronomy at home instead of attending high school. After a brief teaching stint in London, he went on to study literature, psychology, and philosophy at the University of London. After graduation, Tolle joined Cambridge University on a research scholarship. A profound inner transformation at the age of 29 saw him eventually turning into a spiritual teacher and counselor. He spreads his teachings through his company, video website, speeches, and workshops, choosing to steer clear of undue focus on commercial motivation. Given the fact that his work focuses on spirituality, he has supporters and detractors in equal measure. In 2011, Watkins Review listed him at 1st place in the ""100 most spiritually influential person in the world"".

	An Introduction to Indian Philosophy, termed by Srila Prabhupada as 'very authoritative', while introducing the reader to the spirit, vast ocean of knowledge and outlook of Indian philosophy, also helps him to grasp thoroughly the central ideas.  Philosophy, in its widest etymological sense, means 'love of knowledge'. It tries to search for knowledge of himself, the world and God, and describes the Indian way of life as we know it.  Indian philosophy denotes the philosophical speculations of all Indian thinkers, ancient or modern, Hindus or non-Hindus, theists or atheists.  Some believe 'Indian philosophy' to be synonymous with 'Hindu philosophy', however, this would be true only if the word 'Hindu' were taken in the geographical sense of 'Indian'.  But if 'Hindu' means the followers of a particular religious faith known as Hinduism, the supposition would be wrong and misleading.  The authors have, with considerable merit, highlighted the significance of Indian views in terms of modern Western thought.  An Introduction to Indian Philosophy is a seminal work covering topics as varied as the Carvaka, Jain, Vaisesika, Mimamsa, Buddha, Sankhya Systems, amongst others.

3,"Wayne W. Dyer,","A book of 81 distinct essays on how to apply the ancient wisdom of the Tao Five hundred years before the birth of Jesus, a God-realized being named Lao-tzu in ancient China dictated 81 verses, which are regarded by many as the ultimate commentary on the nature of our existence. The classic text of these 81 verses, called the Tao Te Ching or the Great Way, offers advice and guidance that is balanced, moral, spiritual, and always concerned with working for the good. In this book, Dr. Wayne W. Dyer has reviewed hundreds of translations of the Tao Te Ching and has written 81 distinct essays on how to apply the ancient wisdom of Lao-tzu to today's modern world. This work contains the entire 81 verses of the Tao, compiled from Wayne's researching of 10 of the most well-respected translations of text that have survived for more than 25 centuries. Each chapter is designed for actually living the Tao or the Great Way today. Some of the chapter titles are ""Living with Flexibility,"" ""Living Without Enemies,"" and ""Living by Letting Go."" Each of the 81 brief chapters focuses on living the Tao and concludes with a section called ""Doing the Tao Now."" Wayne spent one entire year reading, researching, and meditating on Lao-tzu's messages, practicing them each day and ultimately writing down these essays as he felt Lao-tzu wanted you to know them. This is a work to be read slowly, one essay a day. As Wayne says, ""This is a book that will forever change the way you look at your life, and the result will be that you'll live in a new world aligned with nature. Writing this book changed me forever, too. I now live in accord with the natural world and feel the greatest sense of peace I've ever experienced.

In The First and Last Freedom, J. Krishnamurti, one of the leading spiritual teachers of our century takes a philosophical and psychological approach towards life and provides the reasons to why we are suffering.

Summary of the Book

Through intriguing discussions on suffering, love and loneliness, sex, death, and the meaning of life, Krishnamurti highlights the significance of self-understanding.

8,"Ayn Rand,","
	Atlas Shrugged is set in an unspecified era in a dystopian United States.The book is divided into three parts, each one containing ten chapters. The names of the three parts refer to Aristotle’s laws of logic. The parts are titled Non-contradiction, Either-Or, and A Is A.

	The novel begins with Dagny Taggart, the Operating Vice President of a giant railroad company, struggling to keep the company afloat in tough economic conditions. As the economy worsens, Taggart begins to notice that the best and brightest people of the society keep disappearing mysteriously. As it eventually turns out, they are being led on a organized strike by John Galt, who aims to bring the motorworld to a halt.

	Under the leadership of Galt, the minds responsible for society’s productivity and growth refuse to be exploited any further by rising taxes and government rules. They seek to prove that the world is headed straight for disaster if every individual is enslaved by the government and society. They fight to demonstrate that robbing an individual off of the freedom to create spells doom for civilization.

	As the government strengthens its dictatorial stance, Taggart begins to see the collapse of society around her. The love story of Dagny Taggart and Hank Rearden, a steel magnate, forms a subplot in the book.

	The book is considered to be Ayn Rand’s magnum opus. It was first published in 1957 and highlights her philosophy of Objectivism. The ‘Atlas’ in the title of the book refers to Atlas, a Titan in Greek mythology. The silver screen adaption of the book got continuously stalled for almost 40 years, and was mired in several controversies. It was finally released on April 15, 2011, but met with mainly negative reviews. This particular edition of the book has an introduction by Rand’s student, Leonard Peikoff.

About the Author
Ayn Rand was a Russian-American author, screenwriter, playwright, and philosopher. She developed a philosophical theory called Objectivism.
	Her fictional works include The Fountainhead, Atlas Shrugged, Anthem, The Night Of January 16th, and We The Living. Some of her non-fictional works are The Romantic Manifesto: A Philosophy of Literature, The Virtue Of Selfishness, and Philosophy: Who Needs It.

	Her writing received strong reviews, both good and bad. Rand’s novels garnered polarized opinions mainly because of the extensive philosophical content in them, which promoted capitalism and individual accomplishments over socialism and team successes.

	Ayn Rand or Alisa Zinov’yevna Rosenbaum was born on February 2, 1905, in St. Petersburg, Russia. Her family was forced to flee to Crimea after the rise of the Bolshevik party. She later returned to Petrograd (now St. Petersburg) and majored in history in the Department of Social Pedagogy at the Petrograd State University. After a visit to America to meet her relatives, she became quite intent on making it her home, which she eventually did. She developed and advocated her philosophy called Objectivism through her writing. Rand died of a heart attack on March 6, 1982, at her New York home.

The oldest military treatise in the world, The Art of War is a collection of strategies, situational methods and basic war advice that has since been integrated into every sphere of life.

Summary of the Book

	Compared to the West's chess-like approach to war, Asia has always followed an approach more suited to the territorial game of Go. In fact, the game itself is supposed to have evolved from the eastern beliefs which have stemmed from Sun Tzu's masterpiece on war and battle. A legendary advisor to kings, Sun Tzu's only surviving legacy is this book, passed down through generations and containing some of the best known strategies and most sensible advice for all kinds of situations. Know your enemy, says Sun Tzu, and know yourself. Knowing competition builds a chance of success. Knowing one's own strengths and weaknesses guarantees it. The teachings of Sun Tzu have been followed to glorious victory in wars across history and they have been ignored to crippling defeats.

About Sun Tzu

	Sun Tzu was a Chinese military strategist, general and philosopher who most likely lived in the Spring and Autumn period of Chinese history. His actual historical existence is under speculation, several historians believe he might have been more than one person.

Hindu View Of Life is a comprehensive look into the depths of Hinduism. It examines the origin, belief systems, rituals, and many other aspects of this religion. Presented in the form of four lectures, this book is very informative and engaging.

Summary Of The Book

Hindu View Of Life, originally published in 1926, introduces readers to the ways of Hindu life, rituals, beliefs, and customs.

	India is a very diverse country filled with a wide range of religions. Hinduism may seem one of the most confusing because of the thousands of gods and goddesses that are worshipped in their various forms. It also has myths and superstitions attached to it. The author takes readers into the depth of Hinduism, and showcases the unifying beliefs that exist amongst all ordinary men and women.

Hindu View Of Life is divided into four lessons. The first is titled Religious Expressions: Its Nature And Content. It says that the word Hindu came into existence as the founders lived on the banks of River Indus, and invaders from other countries started calling them Hindus. The author also says that Hindus should not confine themselves into building temples and performing rites. Instead, all of Hinduism should strive to reach higher spiritual plane. Lecture two is Conflict Of Religions: The Hindu Attitude, and it says that Hinduism is a religion that has accepted all kinds of gods. It doesn’t believe in converting individuals, and lays emphasis on the fact that conduct is more important that belief. The next two lectures are Hindu Dharma I and II. 

Hindu View Of Life uncovers the complexities of this religion. It shows that there is so much more to Hinduism that what is expressed by Indians on a daily basis. Infact, Radhakrishnan says that Hindu families irrespective of their differences in rituals, customs, and rites, are all guided by certain common beliefs. This book is very informative, and takes readers into the deepest aspects of one of the oldest religions of the world.

	Elegant, startling, and universal in its applications, The Black Swan is a concept that will change the way you look at the world. Black Swans underlie almost everything, from the rise of religions, to events in our own personal lives. A Black Swan is a highly improbable event with three principle characteristics: it is unpredictable; it carries a massive impact; and, after the fact, we concoct an explanation that makes it appear less random and more predictable than it was. The astonishing success of Google was a black swan so was 9/11. And why do we always ignore the phenomenon of Black Swans until after they occur? As Nassim Nicholas Taleb reveals, we are hard-wired not to truly estimate risk, too vulnerable to the impulse to simplify, narrate, and categorize and not open enough to rewarding those who can imagine the ‘impossible’. In this revelatory book, Taleb explains everything we know about what we don’t know, and shows us how to face the world.

Confronting and solving problems is a painful process which most of us attempt to avoid. And the very avoidance results in greater pain and an inability to grow both mentally and spiritually.

He discusses the nature of loving relation-ships: how to recognize true compatibility; how to distinguish dependency from love; how to become one's own person and how to be a more sensitive parent.

Notes from a Small Room brings a collection of essays written by Ruskin Bond.

Summary of the Book

	This book celebrates the uncomplicated pleasures of a life well-lived. It explains how the simplest of the joys keeps us from going crazy. Bond explains how the smallest joyous moments move him immensely – the sound of a tropical downpour, the fragrance of the lime trees in the Himalayas, or even a year he spends with Suzie, his cat. The essays in this volume will take you on a quieter journey where time doesn’t move hastily. They will make you contemplate on the bigger questions, those that help you find the extraordinary in the mundane, the grandeur in the simplest of the things.
