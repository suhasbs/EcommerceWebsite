Angels And Demons by Dan Brown is a thriller featuring events that directly implicate the Vatican and the Catholic Church, with an ancient brotherhood, a devastating weapon, and an unlikely target all thrown into the mix.

Summary Of The Book
	Robert Langdon, a renowned Harvard symbologist is the protagonist of Angels And Demons, a prequel to The Da Vinci Code. A phone call from the Director of the CERN summons him to a Swiss facility where a strange symbol is found seared onto the chest of a dead physicist. When Langdon examines the body, he discovers that it is a symbol of the Illuminati, an ancient but powerful underground brotherhood. Langdon fears that this brotherhood may have returned to seek out their vendetta against the Catholic Church.
 
	Langdon’s suspicions are confirmed when the Illuminati’s messenger announces that they have hidden a time bomb in the heart of the Vatican City. Langdon teams up with Vittoria Vetra, the dead physicist’s daughter in order to locate the time bomb. During the investigation, Langdon discovers that Vittoria and her deceased father were trying to isolate antimatter using a giant particle accelerator. This antimatter is kept with a 24-hour backup such that if the canister is removed from the main system, the backup will continue to keep both types of matter isolated. When one of these canisters is reported missing, the Illuminati become the prime suspects.
 
	While this is going on, the Vatican readies itself to elect the next Pope from a list of four candidates. However, these four candidates are found missing. It is up to Vittoria and Langdon to uncover symbolic clues and find the missing candidates and save the people of Rome from destruction. In Angels And Demons, the battle between religion and science turns into a fight for survival.

Angels And Demons was turned into a movie and released in 2009, starring Tom Hanks.

The focal point of the novel is the NSA’s clandestine TRANSLTR, capable of deciphering any code and designed for the purpose invading the nation’s Internet privacy, and one man’s ingenious creation - the NSA’s worst nightmare.

Summary Of The Book

Digital Fortress, a science fiction thriller novel by Dan Brown, was published in 1998 and since then has been translated into several foreign languages.
 
	To avoid public unrest, the common man of course is kept oblivious of the fact that the NSA is using its supercomputer, the TRANSLTR, to pry into their emails, with the objective of maintaining national security. Anxiety starts brewing, when an NSA expellee, devises an ingenious algorithm that is effective in formulating codes that even the TRANSLTR is incapable of decrypting.
 
	Stumped by this new dilemma, Strathmore, commander of NSA, assigns the head cryptographer, Susan Fletcher to translate it. As Susan works on cracking this complicated cipher, Digital Fortress, she discerns the identity of the coder: Ensei Tankado, who strictly disapproves infringing upon people’s private lives! Susan further discovers that Tankado’s design, is to auction the Digital Fortress algorithm on his website and if this isn’t bad enough, ‘NDAKOTA’, his partner would expose it freely to the world, in the event of Tankado’s death. This would be too big a blow for the NSA.
 
	Before enough can be done to crack the code however, news arrives from Seville that Tankado had died of what seemed to be a heart attack. When Commander Strathmore dispatches Susan’s fiancé to salvage the victim’s thumb ring, which he believes holds the key to disclose digital Fortress, Becker arrives to find that Tankado entrusted the ring to someone just before he died. While Becker tries to gather further information, an unknown assassin goes around slaughtering everyone that he has questioned.
 
	The story spins deeper into the labyrinth with a series of events all taking place synchronously; we witness the enigmatic phone conversation between Numakata and NDAKOTA. The book ends by revealing the true identity of NDAKOTA and finally, the secret of Digital Fortress.
 
	The novel is quite fast paced and like all of Dan Brown’s books, has received favorable reviews world over.

The captain walked to the window and looked out. The moon had gone in again, and it was raining heavily. He could hear the deep sough of the wind, and see the dark loom of the trees, all swaying in the one direction. It was a sight which gave a zest to his comfortable quarters, and to the cold fowl and the bottle of wine which the butler had brought up for him. He was tired and hungry after his long tramp, so he threw his sword, his helmet, and his revolver-belt down upon a chair, and fell to eagerly upon his supper. Then, with his glass of wine before him and his cigar between his lips, he tilted his chair back and looked about him. He sat within a small circle of brilliant light which gleamed upon his silver shoulder-straps, and threw out his terra-cotta face, his heavy eyebrows, and his yellow moustache. But outside that circle things were vague and shadowy in the old dining-hall. Two sides were oak-panelled and two were hung with faded tapestry, across which huntsmen and dogs and stags were still dimly streaming. Above the fireplace were rows of heraldic shields with the blazonings of the family and of its alliances, the fatal saltire cross breaking out on each of them. Four paintings of old seigneurs of Chateau Noir faced the fireplace, all men with hawk noses and bold, high features, so like each other that only the dress could distinguish the Crusader from the Cavalier of the Fronde. Captain Baumgarten, heavy with his repast, lay back in his chair looking up at them through the clouds of his tobacco smoke, and pondering over the strange chance which had sent him, a man from the Baltic coast, to eat his supper in the ancestral hall of these proud Norman chieftains. But the fire was hot, and the captain's eyes were heavy.

19,"Sir Edmund Hillary,","
The authoritative first-person account of Hillary and Tenzing’s ascent of Mount Everest, reissued on the 60th anniversary of this landmark achievement.
 
	In 1953, when he was thirty-three years old, Edmund Hillary became the first man to stand at the summit of Mount Everest, the Holy Grail for a generation of mountain climbers who had tried and failed to reach the highest point on earth (29,035 feet). High Adventure is Hillary’s definitive and wonderfully entertaining memoir of his Himalayan quest, beginning with the 1951 expedition that discovered a possible route up the south slope of Everest, and culminating in the successful expedition of 1953 led by Sir John Hunt. Hillary’s memoir takes us step-by step up the slopes of Everest, describing vividly and in great detail the agonizing climb that he and Tenzing Norgay embarked upon, the perils they faced, and the dramatic final ascent that forever secured them a place of honour in the annals of human exploration.
 
	High Adventure is a mountaineering classic, to be sure. But it is also a thrilling and inspiring story of courage and endurance – a story that will captivate a new generation of readers on the 60th anniversary of Hillary’s extraordinary achievement.

About the author
Sir Edmund Hillary (1919-2008) was born in New Zealand, and served in the New Zealand Air Force in World War II. He was a participant in the 1951 and 1952 Everest expeditions, and on 29 May 1953, he and the Nepalese mountaineer Tenzing Norgay became the first men to reach the summit of Mount Everest. After being knighted following the ascent, he achieved many more adventuring ‘firsts’ in surroundings as varied as the Antarctica and the Ganges. He established the Himalayan Trust, an organization devoted to improving the lives of the Himalayan people, which has built schools, hospitals and infrastructure for the isolated mountain communities. Hillary died of heart failure on 11 January 2008 at the Auckland City Hospital.
