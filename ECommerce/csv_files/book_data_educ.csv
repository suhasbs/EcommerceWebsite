History Of Medieval India is the second book in a series written to provide a comprehensive overview of the history of the Indian subcontinent.

Summary Of The Book

History Of Medieval India covers the historical landscape of the Indian subcontinent over a period of a thousand years, between the eighth and eighteenth century AD. The book starts off with a bird’s eye view of the state of the world during the medieval period, before dwelling on the rise and fall of empires in the Indian subcontinent.

	Writing about the history of India is a daunting task, but the author has attempted to carry out the task with the eye of an inquirer and the pen of a scholar. The book has been written keeping in mind readers who may have some basic knowledge of the political situation in medieval India and would like to pursue the knowledge further. The book elucidates the beginnings, growths and deaths of many a dynasty, including but not limited to the Cholas, Rajputs, Vijayanagara kings, Bahmanids and the Marathas.

	History Of Medieval India’s primary merit lies in the fact that it departs from the well worn path of writing about dynastic history alone and looks at the social, political, cultural and economic developments that the period gave rise to. Some of these developments still have significance in contemporary relevance, such as the caste system which seems to have been born around this period.

	The author has done a tremendous job in condensing such a large amount of subject matter in such a small space.

	He has composed many works and some of them include, Essays on Medieval Indian History, Historiography, Religion and State in Medieval India, State, Pluralism and the Indian Historical Tradition, and The Indian Ocean and its Islands: Strategic, Scientific and Historical Perspectives.

Concrete Technology: Theory And Practice is a comprehensive guide on concrete, one that is used by students, architects and practicing and consulting engineers alike.

Summary Of The Book

Concrete Technology: Theory and Practice was first published in 1982, when it was mentioned in the book that India was producing 22 million tons of cement. In 2004, this amount became 120 million tons, and today, India is second only to China in the production of cement.

	These statistics are emphasised, as well as the need to understand concrete and its workings, in Concrete Technology: Theory and Practice. The seventh edition has taken into account the changes that have been occurring in the constantly dynamic and still rather nascent industry of concrete.

	Chemical admixtures have become common practice, from contractors in urban areas to rural villages. Different admixtures that go into the making of high-performance concrete, like PC admixtures as well as mineral admixtures are covered extensively in Concrete Technology: Theory and Practice.

	With the increase in infrastructural projects in India involving bridges, roads and flyovers, it has become necessary to adopt mass concreting practices. These techniques are covered elaborately in this book. Ready-mixed concrete, and its transport, pumping and placement have also been discussed at length.

	Recently, the code of practice for plain and reinforced concrete introduced IS 456:2000, a revision which rendered the previous guidelines in concrete mix design outdated. This revision has also been taken into account in Concrete Technology: Theory and Practice, along with the most recent durability tests such as Water Penetration Tests and Rapid Chloride Permeability Tests, according to the ASTM and DIN standards.

	Other topics such as creep and shrinkage in concrete, the use of water, SCC or Self Compacting Concrete, fresh concrete and the strength of concrete are discussed in this book.

About M. S. Shetty

	Professor M. S. Shetty is a retired civil engineer, who has over 50 years of professional experience, having worked as a site engineer, researcher, professor, consultant and post-graduate guide.

	After retirement, he has conducted over a hundred training programs on the different aspects of Concrete Technology. These programs have been attended by site engineers from large construction companies as well as private contractors and employees from the central and state governments departments. He was previously the Vice President of Indian Concrete Institute.
